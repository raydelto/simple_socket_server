# Simple Socket Server (S3)
Simple Socket Server (S3) is a simple application that listen to a specified port and prints out all data that it receives.   Its main objective is to debug information that devices automatically send over the Internet Protocol.

I have created this simple project since I was working with a car GPS Tracker that had the option to send geolocation information over GPRS.  While debugging to see exactly what was it sending the the specified IP and port I needed a host where the device could connect, and a mechanism to read what is the device actually sending.

I hope this tool could be helpful for you. Any enhacements are welcome.
